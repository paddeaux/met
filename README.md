## Use of synthetic data for physiography

The primary research area of my PhD relates to the generation of synthetic geographic data. With this in mind, the brief for my 12-week internship with Met Éireann is to apply synthetic data to produce a "proof-of-concept" for using synthetic data to aid in Met Éireann's research.
